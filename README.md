This specialization includes 5 courses
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network)
3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects)
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)
5. [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)

Because there is no programming assignments for the course **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**, this course has no folder in this repository.
